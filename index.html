 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file. Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images and pdf's, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own Electrate experience.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we will need to make some changes on your style.css file. developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block." You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image on the style.css page. Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder (directory) as this project (hint: simplify the name). Change the other relevant information, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"'--whatever that is?-->

  <h2>Family is that collection of individuals that are bound together in life, even when apart. Family is marked by love that is sacrificial, resilient, and fiercely loyal. My mom and dad are wonderful examples of this. They enjoy going on bike rides together - and now they have the time to do so now that my siblings and I are in college! My triplet siblings are also family, but in a special way. When I say "we" without explanation or clear referent, I mean The Trio. Cats are also family, if they trust you enough to ask you for food. These cats are Milo and Spoke, both raised in a barn and none the worse for the wear.</h2>

This might sound weird, but Gregory Ulmer, who we discussed above, says that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person and how you language yourself. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You will have some opportunities to add video content or other content. You might add an image (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) or perhaps add a photo grid like the one you did for "Family." Experiment. You can't break this thing!

When I don't enjoy school, it isn't for the reasons you might think. I usually have a specific set of things I want to learn, and when I spend too much time on busy work, my learning is hindered. Luckily, I have had wonderful professors who have taught me a great deal. The learning will continue for the forseable future, as I am currently applyingn to graduate school. There I will be expected to contribute to novel and independent research, and it seems a worthy goal. Let us hope I find a worthy topic to research! </h2>
